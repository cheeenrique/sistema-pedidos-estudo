# DDD + Clean Architecture

- `Domain` must not reference `Application`, `Infrastructure`, or `Api`.
- Keep aggregate consistency rules inside aggregate root methods.
- Use repositories only as abstractions in `Application`; implement them in `Infrastructure`.
- Organize use cases by feature and action: `Orders/Commands/CreateOrder`, `Orders/Queries/GetOrderById`.
- Keep controllers thin: map HTTP input to command/query and delegate to MediatR.
- Avoid anemic domain model: business behavior belongs to entities/value objects, not only handlers.
