# Core Engineering Standards

- Use clear names in English for classes, methods, variables, and files.
- Keep methods small and focused on a single reason to change.
- Depend on abstractions from `Application` or `Domain`, not concrete infrastructure details.
- Prefer immutable request/response contracts with `record` for API and CQRS boundaries.
- Validate input at boundaries and enforce business invariants inside domain entities.
- Use explicit error handling with meaningful messages; do not swallow exceptions.
- Avoid comments that restate obvious code; add comments only for non-trivial decisions.
