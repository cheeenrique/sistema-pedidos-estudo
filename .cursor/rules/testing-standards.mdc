# Testing Standards

- Use Arrange-Act-Assert with clear test names: `Method_ShouldBehavior_WhenCondition`.
- Unit tests must isolate domain/application behavior and avoid database dependencies.
- Integration tests should cover API contract, persistence flow, and critical security behavior.
- Assert business outcomes, not implementation details.
- Add regression tests for every bug fix.
