# Project Documentation Hub

This folder centralizes the project knowledge to keep implementation aligned and reduce context loss.

## Documents

- `architecture.md`: layer boundaries, design principles, and dependency rules.
- `setup.md`: local environment, dependencies, and run/build commands.
- `roadmap.md`: phased learning and implementation plan.
- `api.md`: current endpoints and contract evolution notes.
- `conventions.md`: naming, code style, and testing conventions.
- `migrations.md`: EF Core migration workflow and team conventions.
- `docker.md`: Docker services, hot reload, and container commands.
- `customers.md`: customer registration fields and business guidance.

## How to use

1. Read `architecture.md` before creating new features.
2. Check `conventions.md` before implementing code changes.
3. Update `api.md` whenever endpoint contracts change.
4. Keep `roadmap.md` synchronized with completed milestones.
